In this paper, we propose a Normalized Gamma Transformation Based Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization with Color Correction for Sand-Dust Image Enhancement



Prerequisites
windows 10+matlab 2018b

Demo using pre-trained model
Since the proposed method uses hdf5 file to load the traning samples, the generate_testsample.py helps you to creat the testing or training sample yourself.

Metric
You can run the PSNRSSIM for quantitative results
